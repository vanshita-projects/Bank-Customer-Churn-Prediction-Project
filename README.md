# **BANK CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT**

## **INTRODUCTION-**

## A Bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange. When new customers start buying and/or using a product in a bank, each new user contributes to the bank product’s growth rate. Certainly, some of those customers in due course will stop their utilization or end their subscription; this could be because they switched to a competitor, no longer need the bank services, they’re unhappy with their user experience, or they can no longer afford the cost. The customers that stop using the bank products are the “churn” for a given period. Which can be can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual churn rate at the bank. This leads to the importance of churn management in organizations such as a bank.

## So,I build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to identify bank customers who are at a risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies and minimizing customer attrition.I use the public dataset that contains 10000 rows and 14 columns and Exited is the target variable column in this case.It contains the following information about customers as-
## •	Credit Score- Credit score of the customer

## •	Geography- The country from which the customer belongs

## •	Gender- Male or Female

## •	Age- Age of the customer

## •	Tenure- Number of years for which the customer has been with the bank. Balance- Bank balance of the customer

## •	Num of Products- Number of bank products the customer is utilizing (savings account, mobile banking, internet banking etc

## •	Has Cr Card- Binary flag for whether the customer holds a credit card with the bank or not

## •	Is Active Member- Binary flag for whether the customer is an active member with the bank or not

## •	Estimated Salary- Estimated salary of the customer in Domain
