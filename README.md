# **BANK CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT**

## **INTODUCTION-**

## A Bank is a financial institution licensed to receive deposits and make loans. Banks may also provide financial services such as wealth management, currency exchange. When new customers start buying and/or using a product in a bank, each new user contributes to the bank product’s growth rate. Certainly, some of those customers in due course will stop their utilization or end their subscription; this could be because they switched to a competitor, no longer need the bank services, they’re unhappy with their user experience, or they can no longer afford the cost. The customers that stop using the bank products are the “churn” for a given period. Which can be can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual churn rate at the bank. This leads to the importance of churn management in organizations such as a bank.
